### Subtask 1: Add ability to upload custom image during product fetch

**Description** 
When a user is adding a new product, they give the web app a product url, and the system fetches the product information, including a product image. The product image, for many reasons, may be wrong. So we want to allow the user to be able to upload an image before saving the new product.

**Requirements**
- Support JPG, PNG, WebP formats
- Max file size of 5MB
- Update product record to use custom image URL

### Subtask 2: Add missing data fields to table column and product details
