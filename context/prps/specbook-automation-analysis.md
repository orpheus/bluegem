# Current implementation uses deprecated patterns - needs ChatCompletion API

# CRITICAL: Firecrawl integration is disabled/commented out in stealth_scraper.py
# Service is paid but provides high-quality fallback scraping

# CRITICAL: HTML processing garbage keyword filtering is commented out
# May impact LLM prompt quality with noisy content

# CRITICAL: Rate limiting in scraper is conservative (10 requests/60 seconds)
# May need adjustment for larger product catalogs

# CRITICAL: No automated testing coverage
# Quality relies entirely on manual verification and evaluation scripts

# CRITICAL: Hard-coded configuration values throughout pipeline
# Environment-specific settings need centralized management
```
