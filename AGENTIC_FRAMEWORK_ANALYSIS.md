## Simple Custom Agentic Framework Requirements

### Core Framework Components

#### **1. Agent Orchestration Layer**
```python
# Central coordinator managing agent lifecycle and communication
class AgentOrchestrator:
    - Agent registration and discovery
    - Task routing and load balancing
    - Inter-agent communication protocols
    - Workflow state management
```

#### **2. Tool Interface Abstraction**
```python
# Unified interface for existing tools
class ToolInterface:
    - Standardized tool calling patterns
    - Parameter validation and type checking
    - Result formatting and error handling
    - Async execution support for parallel processing
```

#### **3. Command Line Interface**
```python
# Terminal-based agent interaction
class AgenticCLI:
    - Natural language command parsing
    - Context-aware command suggestions
    - Progress tracking and status updates
    - Interactive confirmation workflows
```

#### **4. State Management System**
```python
# Persistent workflow state and history
class StateManager:
    - Project context persistence
    - Workflow checkpointing and resume
    - Agent memory and learning
    - Audit trail and rollback capabilities
```

### Integration Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Tool Wrapper Layer**
- Create unified interfaces for existing tools (`stealth_scraper`, `llm_invocator`, etc.)
- Implement standardized input/output formats
- Add async execution capabilities for parallel processing
- Establish error handling and retry mechanisms

#### **Phase 2: Agent Coordination**
- Extend existing `agent/verification_framework.py` as foundation
- Implement task distribution and workflow orchestration
- Add inter-agent communication via message queues
- Create agent lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, terminate)

#### **Phase 3: CLI Integration**
- Build command parser that translates natural language to agent tasks
- Implement context-aware suggestions and autocomplete
- Add interactive workflows for complex operations
- Create progress monitoring and real-time feedback

### Technical Requirements

#### **Dependencies**
- **Message Queue**: Redis for agent communication
- **State Storage**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for workflow persistence
- **CLI Framework**: Rich/Typer for terminal UI
- **Async Runtime**: asyncio for concurrent operations

#### **Architecture Patterns**
- **Event-driven communication** between agents
- **Command pattern** for tool invocation
- **State machine** for workflow management
- **Observer pattern** for progress monitoring
