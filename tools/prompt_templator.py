        You are a project architect tasked with fetching specification details from the following product website's HTML page. Extract the relevant product information for documentation in a specification book.

        If you are not 99.9% sure that the information is correct, return the value with the highest probability, including the probability in the value field.

        TITLE:
        product_data['title']

        PRODUCT URL:

        TEXT CONTENT:
        product_data['text']

        IMAGES:
        product_data['images']

        Extract the following structured data in JSON format from the provided product web page:

        - image_url: Direct URL to the product image. If the url is a relative url, append to the base_url **without modifying the url as found in the html <img> tag**. Prioritize <img> tag urls that have an `id` attribute or any attribute with a value that relates it to the main product image.
        - type: The product category (e.g. range hood, grill, fireplace, etc.).
        - description: Short product description, including brand, size, material, color, and any notable features
        - model_no: Manufacturer model number, item no, or sku no.
        - product_link: Original product page URL.
        - qty: Quantity if specified; otherwise return "unspecified".
        - key: A unique reference key (if available).

        Return your output in this JSON format without the json tag and codeblocks.
        You **donâ€™t add extra formatting instructions yourself**:
