Most minor scratches can be softened with a fine (white) 3M Scotch Brite pad, or 3M Scotch Brite Natural Fiber Non-Scratch Scour Pad, accompanied by a deep cleansing agent such as Bar Keepers Friend.\nWhat does \"KHU\" stand for?\nKraus Handmade Undermount\nCan stainless steel sinks rust?\nNo. Typically, when red spots appear on a Stainless Steel Sink it is simply surface discoloration due to iron and mineral deposits in the water. This is usually taken care of permanently with a stainless steel polish and/or cleaner when used according to the directions of the cleaning product. Products such as Bar Keeper's friend and a fine 3M Scotch Brite pad are both great options.\nIs it recommended to drill additional holes in my stainless steel sink?\nWe do not recommend making additional holes in a stainless steel sink as it could potentially damage and compromise the integrity of the sink.\nSpecifications\nSink Color Finish:\nSatin\nSink Material:\nStainless Steel\nBowl Configuration:\nSingle Bowl\nMinimum Cabinet Size:\n36\"\nSink Gauge:\n16\nSoap Dispenser Included:\nNo\nSink Length Range:\n31in-35in\nBottom Grid Included:\nYes\nBowl Depth Range:\n9in-10in\nReviews\nStandart PRO\nTM\n32\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nModel #:\nKHU100-32\n$\n319\n95\nActivation\nSingle Bowl\nDouble Bowl 60/40\nDouble Bowl 60/40 Offset\nSize\n32\"\n10\"\n13\"\n14\"\n17\"\n21\"\n23\"\n24\"\n25\"\n26\"\n27\"\n28\"\n30\"\nNeed Help Deciding?\nLet the experts at Kraus help you plan your perfect kitchen with a curated selection of kitchen sinks, faucets, and accessories\nHelp Me Choose\nCall Our Experts\nRelated Products\nCheck items to add to the cart or\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n23\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-23\n$\n299\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n30\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU100-30\n$\n319\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n27\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU110-27\n$\n379\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n33\" Undermount 60/40 Double Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU103-33\n$\n519\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n10\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Bar Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-10\n$\n179\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n21\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-21\n$\n279\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n25\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU111-25\n$\n359\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n28\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU100-28\n$\n379\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n14\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Bar Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-14\n$\n229\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n33\" Undermount 60/40 Double Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU104-33\n$\n519\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n24\" Undermount 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Single Bowl Laundry Utility Sink\nKHU101-24L\n$\n319\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nStandart PRO\nTM\n26\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU100-26\n$\n359\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n17\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Bar Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-17\n$\n229\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n32\" Undermount 60/40 Double Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU103-32\n$\n419\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n13\" Undermount Single Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Bar Kitchen Sink\nKHU101-13\n$\n209\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nOn Sale\nStandart PRO\nTM\n33\" Undermount 50/50 Double Bowl 16 Gauge Stainless Steel Kitchen Sink\nKHU102-33\n$\n449\n95\nAdd to Wish List\nCOMPARE\nTotal price\n$0.00\nSome of these items ship sooner than others\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 - Kraus USA, Inc.

Not well suited for laminate or tile counters which have too many weak points along seams and grout lines to support the weight of the sink.\nDoes the bottom have a slope?\nYes, our sinks are engineered with 1/8\" slope to easily help guide water towards the drain.\nCan I purchase additional feet and bumpers for my sink grid?\nYes, you can purchase additional grid feet and bumpers by contacting us directly at 800-775-0703 or via email at customerservice@kraususa.com\nIs there sound dampening material?\nYes, this sink includes NoiseDefend Soundproofing technology and offers extra thick pads covering over 80% of the sink and non-toxic undercoating for added insulation.\nWhat should I use to clean the sink?\nWe recommend using mild soap and water for everyday cleaning as well as stainless steel cleaners designed for cleaning stainless steel specifically.

These are merely usage scratches over time, these scratches will become uniform with the sink's grain and blend into the overall finish of your sink with proper cleaning.

After making failed attempts at knitting fiberglass as a means of creating structure, Pot resorted to coiling a strand of epoxy-dipped fiberglass around a large balloon in varying patterns. Once the form had completely dried, the balloon was popped, leaving behind a dramatic globe-shaped form that serves as the diffuser for this stunningly airy pendant lamp. Random Light is suitable for entryways, lounge areas and dining rooms, with a light bulb visible at the center of the globe when lit, creating an all-over glow with minimal glare. Bulb (not included): incandescent 60W/A19/E26. UL Listed. Made in the Netherlands.\nThis pendant is not precisely spherical, featuring denser fiberglass on the end opposite the bulb access opening. We recommend mounting it no more than 4\" from the opening to ensure it emits the most symmetrical lighting pattern.\nWhite and black versions each include a chrome socket, chrome canopy and black cord.\nMeasure for a perfect fit with our delivery guide: https://www.dwr.com/furniture-delivery-guide.html\nBrand\nMoooi\nGeneral Dimensions\n20\u215b\" H 20\u215b\" W 20\u215e\" D 19\u00be\" DIA\nProduct Weight\n2.25 lbs\nAssembly\nRequires Assembly\nWarranty\n1-year warranty\nTerms and conditions apply.\nLearn more\nDimensions\nSmall\nHeight (in): 20\u215b\nWidth (in): 20\u215b\nDiameter (in): 19\u00be\nDepth (in): 20\u215e\nWeight (lbs): 2.25\nCord Length (in): 143\u00be\nShade Diameter (in): 19\u00be\nMax/Min Wattage: 60\nLumen: 800\nMedium\nHeight (in): 34\u00bc\nWidth (in): 34\u00bc\nDiameter (in): 31\u00bd\nDepth (in): 34\u00bc\nWeight (lbs): 2.25\nCord Length (in): 143\u00be\nShade Diameter (in): 31\u00bd\nMax/Min Wattage: 60\nLumen: 800\nLarge\nHeight (in): 43\nWidth (in): 43\nDiameter (in): 41\nDepth (in): 43\nWeight (lbs): 4.5\nCord Length (in): 143\u00be\nShade Diameter (in): 41\nMax/Min Wattage: 60\nLumen: 800\nEpoxy-coated fiberglass diffuser\nChrome socket and canopy\nBertjan Pot\nDesigning furniture, lighting and other home products, Bertjan Pot emphasizes materials, which he sees as a critical but often overlooked element of the design process.
