[Phase 4.3] AssetManager Implementation
- Created comprehensive AssetManager class (`src/main/services/AssetManager.ts`)
  - Content-addressable storage using SHA-256 hashes
  - Automatic thumbnail generation with configurable dimensions
  - Deduplication through hash-based storage
  - Reference counting for safe asset cleanup
  - Batch import capabilities for multiple assets
- Core features implemented:
  - `storeAsset()` - Store images with automatic deduplication
  - `getAssetPath()` - Retrieve asset file paths with access tracking
  - `deleteAsset()` - Safe deletion with reference counting
  - `cleanupOrphans()` - Remove unreferenced assets
  - `importAssets()` - Batch import with progress tracking
  - `getStatistics()` - Asset storage metrics
- Security and validation:
  - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
  - File size limits (default 50MB)
  - Dimension constraints (configurable min/max)
  - Corrupt file detection
- Successfully tested all features:
  - Asset storage and retrieval working
  - Deduplication correctly detecting identical files
  - Thumbnails generating at 200x200 default size
  - Reference counting preventing premature deletion
  - Batch import with duplicate detection

[Phase 4.2] Database Schema Migration
- Implemented comprehensive database migration system in ProjectFileManager
  - Added `migrateDatabase()` method for automatic schema updates
  - Created `getSchemaVersion()` and `applyMigration()` for version tracking
  - Migration runs automatically on project open and creation
- Added asset management database schema
  - New columns in products table: image_hash, thumbnail_hash, images_hashes
  - New assets metadata table for tracking stored assets
  - Performance indexes on ref_count and last_accessed for efficient queries
- Successfully tested migration on both new and existing projects
