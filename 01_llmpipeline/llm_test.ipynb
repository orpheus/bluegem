    "The pull-down spray wand comes free with a gentle tug and gives you total flexibility. The hose extends and retracts without friction points, fed by gravity. As you raise the wand to dock it, the magnet embedded in the spout pulls the wand precisely into place. So, unlike other pull-downs that tend to droop over time, MagnaTite® keeps your pull-down faucet looking picture-perfect. Delta's exclusive DIAMOND Seal® Technology uses a valve with a tough diamond coating. InnoFlex® PEX waterways keep water inside the faucet out of contact with potential metal contaminants. This powerful combination brings you a faucet built to last up to five million uses. Only Delta faucets are equipped with Touch-Clean® soft, rubber spray holes that allow you to easily wipe away calcium and lime build-up with the touch of a finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MagnaTite docking keeps the kitchen pull-down spray wand firmly in place with a powerful integrated magnet, so it stays docked when not in use\n",
    "- Diamond Seal® Technology is less hassle to install and helps your faucet perform like new for life, reducing leak points and lasting twice as long as the industry standard\n",
    "- Meets standards set by Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n",
    "- Touch-Clean spray holes allow for easy removal of hard water build-up\n",
    "- 1 or 3-hole 8 in. installation (with optional escutcheon, not included)\n",
    "- The high-arc, gooseneck design swivels 360 degrees with a 20-in. retractable hose for added convenience during everyday kitchen tasks\n",

    "Great faucetThis is a great faucet, and I am extremely particular. My wife and I bought one for our house 4 years ago, and we love it. We just bought another one for my mom’s condominium, to replace a 20 year old faucet that was leaking. We didn’t consider any other faucets because this one has been so great. The plumbers that installed it agreed, it said it will be the next faucet they personally buy. We also have used faucet direct several times since at least 2016 and have been very pleased.\n",

    "Sturdy setupSo far liking this faucet set, easy to use, sturdy, the tighter coil in hose is nice and won’t get as dirty, hose does extended out. Not plastic.\n",
