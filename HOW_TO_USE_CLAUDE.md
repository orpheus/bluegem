1. Let go - the code is no longer yours
2. Don't worry about understanding all the code, just understand the achitecture patterns and the documentation it generates
3. Have CLAUDE document everything it does for traceability
4. Create a system for CLAUDE to document else it gets messy
5. Spend a lot of time thinking about how to verify and validate CLAUDE's work
6. Have CLAUDE build human-in-the-loop validation methods
7. CLAUDE will be as focused as you are, so stay focused to what you actually need to build - don't get lost in CandyLand
8. Have CLAUD build the macro system first, and then start sculpting away
9. Understand the MACRO system, refactor as needed, then build in more specific features
10. Have Claude implement a CHANGELOG and version on each change
